          NEITHER WE NOR OUR SUBSIDIARIES, OR AFFILIATES, AND RESPECTIVE
          OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR
          REPRESENTATIVES (OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS) SHALL BE

          DAMAGES. IN ANY EVENT, YOU AGREE THAT OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES,
          REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ACTUAL TOTAL

          You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and release us, our
          subsidiaries, our affiliates, and our respective officers, directors,

          costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable

        </p>
        <h2>General Provisions</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms of Use are found to be invalid or
          unenforceable, such provision shall be severed from the remainder of
          the Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. No
          waiver of any breach or default of the Terms of Use shall be deemed to
          be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. You may
          be required to agree to additional terms and conditions to access
          particular sections or functions of the Service. We reserve the right,
          in our sole discretion and without consent or notice, to transfer,
          assign, sublicense, or pledge the Service or these Terms of Use, in
          whole or in part, to any person or entity. You may not assign,
          sublicense, or otherwise transfer in any manner any of your rights or
          obligations under the Terms of Use. The section headings used in the
          Terms of Use are for convenience only.
        </p>
        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without
          prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including
          without limitation if you breach the Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive
          termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation,
          ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations
          of liability.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace
          these Terms at any time. What constitutes a material change will be
          determined at our sole discretion.
